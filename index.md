## Jinsung Kim

Hello, my name is Jinsung Kim. I am currently pursuing my M.S. in AI and Informatics at Sangmyung University, expecting to complete my degree by August 2024. I also hold a B.S. in Human-Centered AI with a double major in Artificial Intelligence, both from Sangmyung University. During my undergraduate studies, I received the Grand Prize at the 2023 Capstone Competition for my work applying AI to real-world applications.

Professionally, I serve as a Postgraduate Researcher in the Interactive Decision Making & Learning Laboratory, where I previously worked as a Graduate Researcher. Beyond academia, I advise HaII Corporation on AI-based systems for cognitive impairment screening and therapy. My early research endeavors include the Samsung Future Technology Development Project, where I presented a poster at the 2023 Samsung Global Technology Symposium and received the Connect Award. I have also taught data analysis at the Data Youth Campus (Korea Data Agency). My primary interests span HCI, Digital Therapeutics, Medical AI, NLP, Multi-Modal Analysis, and Reinforcement Learning, supported by experience in Python, Java, C/C++, and various AI frameworks.

Hello, Professor Jeong Hyeong-gu!

My name is Jinsung Kim. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Human-Centered Intelligence Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Convergence at Sangmyung University, as well as my Master's degree in Intelligent Information Engineering from the same institution. I am currently serving as a Postgraduate Researcher at Sangmyung University, where I receive dedicated guidance in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and digital therapeutics.

From my undergraduate days, I have been deeply fascinated by the intersection of HCI and healthcare-focused AI, with a particular emphasis on research concerning the elderly. My work has involved leveraging diverse data sources—including neuropsychology, voice analysis (both linguistic and acoustic), eye gaze tracking, and biosignal monitoring (ECG, PPG, RPPG)—to develop innovative screening tools and digital therapeutic applications for conditions such as dementia, depression, and diabetes.

One of my most significant research endeavors involved an in-depth study of eye-tracking methodologies. In this project, I visualized previously unexplored patterns, formalized these observations mathematically, validated them statistically, and applied machine learning models for decoding analysis. Although the resulting paper is still under review, the rigorous two-to-three-year process left me with an immense sense of accomplishment, reigniting my passion for uncovering hidden insights in complex data.

Moreover, during my Master's studies, I had the privilege of working as a machine learning technology advisor at HAII—a digital therapeutics company led by Professor Jinwoo Kim at Yonsei University. This role provided me with hands-on experience interacting with diverse datasets from hospitals and institutions, as well as direct engagement with elderly patients. These experiences have not only enhanced my practical expertise in machine learning and deep learning but also broadened my perspective on applying these technologies to solve real-world healthcare challenges.

My research interests span reinforcement learning for cognitive assessments, the development of multimodal digital biomarkers, and the practical application of AI to diagnose and manage chronic conditions. I am committed to bridging the gap between theoretical research and clinical practice, striving to develop solutions that improve the quality of life for older adults.

Thank you for visiting my homepage. I look forward to sharing my research journey and contributions in the realms of HCI and digital therapeutics.

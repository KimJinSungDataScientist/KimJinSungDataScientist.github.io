## Jinsung Kim
### Postgraduate Researcher, Sangmyung University

Hello, I’m Jinsung Kim, a Postgraduate Researcher in Intelligent Information Engineering at Sangmyung University. My work centers on integrating advanced AI methods into practical healthcare solutions, particularly for older adults. I’m especially interested in human-computer interaction (HCI), digital therapeutics, and multi-modal data analysis—such as voice, eye gaze, and biosignals—to aid in early screening and management of conditions like dementia, depression, and diabetes.

During my time at HAII, a digital therapeutics company led by Professor Jinwoo Kim at Yonsei University, I gained valuable experience handling diverse clinical datasets and interacting with elderly patients. This hands-on approach strengthened my expertise in machine learning and deep learning, and reinforced my commitment to creating user-centric, AI-driven tools that meaningfully enhance patient outcomes. Feel free to reach out via email if you have any questions or potential collaboration ideas.

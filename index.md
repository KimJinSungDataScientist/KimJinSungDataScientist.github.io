## Jinsung Kim
### Postgraduate Researcher, Sangmyung University

I am a Postgraduate Researcher in Intelligent Information Engineering at Sangmyung University, focusing on bridging the gap between advanced AI technologies and real-world healthcare applications. My primary interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and digital therapeutics, with a special emphasis on older adults. Throughout my undergraduate and Master’s studies, I have explored a wide range of data modalities—neuropsychological, voice (linguistic & acoustic), eye gaze, and biosignals (ECG, PPG, RPPG)—to develop screening tools and digital therapeutics for dementia, depression, and diabetes.

During my time at HAII, a digital therapeutics company led by Professor Jinwoo Kim at Yonsei University, I gained hands-on experience working with various hospital and institutional datasets, as well as direct interactions with elderly patients. These opportunities not only strengthened my expertise in machine learning and deep learning but also deepened my commitment to delivering AI-driven solutions that can genuinely improve patient outcomes. My ultimate goal is to develop robust, user-centric digital therapeutics that integrate seamlessly into everyday healthcare.
